# Overly Fancy Tax Calculator

This is a small project to solve the provided coding challenge. 

### Problem Selection
I decided against the third problem as roman number parser are not interesting to implement.
I decided against the second problem as it NP-hard (by reduction from subsetsum for a single track). Of course, the problem is still solvable especially with these input sizes.
So I took on the first Problem.
